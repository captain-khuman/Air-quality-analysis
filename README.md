Air Quality Trend Analysis (ML)								          		
Analyzed air quality by studying various atmospheric gasses, assessing pollution levels across cities. Employed machine learning for robust insights, categorizing pollution intensity (high, poor, low, moderate).
Analyzed and preprocessed air quality data using Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.
Conducted data cleaning, outlier handling, and feature engineering for enhanced dataset quality.
Utilized machine learning for missing value estimation, leveraging correlations between parameters.
Implemented standard scaling and labeled encoding.
Generated visualizations for comprehensive insights, including heatmaps and scatter plots.
